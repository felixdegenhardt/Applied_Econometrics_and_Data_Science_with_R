# Applied Econometrics and Data_Science with R

## Welcome!

Welcome to the course Applied Econometrics and Data Science with R! We’re excited to spend the next weeks with you and the great statistical programming language R. At the end of the course, you will be able to…

* **Work with data in R**
Clean, organize, and analyze large datasets to answer real economic research questions.

* **Write clear and professional code**
Produce easy-to-read R code that creates high-quality tables, graphs, and results.

* **Make and explain data decisions**
Explain your choices when processing data and compare different methods (including basic machine learning tools) using objective measures.

## Course design and prerequisites
The course consists of two main elements: Introduction to working with R and introduction to Machine learning. We will cover both topics in a very hands-on way, by giving you a basic understanding and then applying the concepts in class. We thus ask you to participate in class and work on your projects during the semester. Please also work on the pre-course task until October 12, 12pm latest that helps us understand the experiences and expectations of all of you. You find the link here.

To start smoothly and solve potential technical problems early, please make sure to **install all required software before the first session**.

The final version of the code and other course materials will be uploaded to both Moodle and GitHub.

## Structure
For this semester’s course, we will meet each week on Wednesdays, 12:15–13:45 in 3.06.S27.

In each session, you will get input into some aspects of applied econometrics and data science and apply them right away. One of the instructors will code live in class, while the other is available for technical assistance. Please bring your laptop to each session and look at the content before class.

Please bring your laptop to the seminars and have a look at the content before each session.
