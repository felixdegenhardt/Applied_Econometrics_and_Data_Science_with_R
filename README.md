# Applied Econometrics and Data Science with R

## Welcome!

Welcome to the course Applied Econometrics and Data Science with R! We’re excited to spend the next weeks with you and the great statistical programming language R. At the end of the course, you will be able to:

* **Work with data in R:** Clean, organize, and analyze large datasets to answer real economic research questions.

* **Write clear and professional code:** Produce easy-to-read R code that creates high-quality tables, graphs, and results.

* **Make and explain data decisions:** Explain your choices when processing data and compare different methods (including basic machine learning tools) using objective measures.

## Course design and prerequisites
The course consists of two main elements: Introduction to working with R and introduction to Machine learning. We will cover both topics in a very hands-on way, by giving you a basic understanding and then applying the concepts in class. We thus ask you to participate in class and work on your projects during the semester.

To start smoothly and solve potential technical problems early, please make sure to **install all required software before the first session**.

## Installation checklist
Please install the following:

* [R (latest version)](https://cran.r-project.org)
* [RStudio Desktop](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
* [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop)
* [Create a GitHub account](https://github.com)

The final version of the code and other course materials will be uploaded to both Moodle and GitHub. 

## Structure
For this semester’s course, we will meet each week on Wednesdays, 12:15–13:45. You can find the detailed course schedule and room information on Moodle.

In each session, you will get input into some aspects of applied econometrics and data science and apply them right away. One of the instructors will code live in class, while the other is available for technical assistance.

Please bring your laptop to the seminars and have a look at the content before each session.
